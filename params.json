  "body": "### The Merlin toolkit.\r\nMerlin is a toolkit for building Deep Neural Network models for statistical parametric speech synthesis. It must be used in combination with a front-end text processor (e.g., Festival) and a vocoder (e.g., STRAIGHT or WORLD).\r\n\r\nThe system is written in Python and relies on the Theano numerical computation library.\r\n\r\nMerlin comes with recipes (in the spirit of the Kaldi automatic speech recognition toolkit) to show you how to build state-of-the art systems.\r\n\r\nMerlin is free software, distributed under an Apache License Version 2.0, allowing unrestricted commercial and non-commercial use alike.\r\n\r\n### Current version\r\nYou can [obtain Merlin from GitHub](https://github.com/CSTR-Edinburgh/merlin).
